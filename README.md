# Enhancing Environmental Monitoring: A Journey with Object Detection in Satellite Imagery

Welcome to the repository that aims to demystify the world of object detection in satellite imagery! Here, you’ll find my adventures in using the DIOR dataset to explore advanced techniques in environmental monitoring. Spoiler alert: it involves a lot of code, some eye-catching visuals, and a few moments of existential dread.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

### Results and Visualizations:
- **Confusionmatrix.png**: A lovely visual of how well my model did—spoiler: it confused some things.
- **F1Curve.png**: A representation of the balance between precision and recall; because life is all about balance, right?
- **labels.jpg** & **labels_correlogram.jpg**: Visual aids to help you understand what was detected (or not detected) during training.
- **P_curve.PNG**, **PR_Curve.PNG**, **R_Curve.PNG**: Curves galore! These graphs might just be the only curves you need to worry about.
- **results.xls**: An Excel file containing a treasure trove of training metrics—bring your own spreadsheets.
- **results.PNG**: A snapshot of the results because screenshots are the modern equivalent of trophies.

### Training Files:
- **hyp.YAML** & **opt.YAML**: These files contain hyperparameters and model options, perfect for anyone who enjoys reading YAML as a bedtime story.
- **train_batch.jpg** & **val_batch_pred.jpg**: Images showcasing what the model saw during training and validation—it's like a photo album, but with more zeros and ones.

### Notebook:
- **ObjectDetection_final.ipynb**: The pièce de résistance, detailing my entire process with a sprinkle of code and a dash of commentary. Perfect for those who enjoy a narrative alongside their data!

### Screenshots:
- Screenshots from the Anaconda command prompt that (somewhat) document the training process—because the Jupyter Notebook was on a vacation and refused to show outputs.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Environmental-Monitoring-Object-Detection.git

## Conclusion
This project is not just a collection of files; it’s a journey into the depths of environmental monitoring through object detection. While I may have stumbled through the process, I hope you find this repository both informative and entertaining. Happy exploring!
